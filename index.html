      <p>
        The changing digital enterprise landscape is bringing change and opportunity to 
        all organizations wishing to leverage to their benefits of converging technologies.
        As enterprises look to move more workloads off-premises, they need strategies to
        mitigate risk and ensure that their service providers can work with any remaining 
        on-premises environments, other key external service providers, while complying with 
        governance and compliance requirements that are also changing.        
        It would be impractical to think of conducting business without digital technologies. 
        They form the backbone of the digital enterprise and also are key to aligning the business 
        with IT for efficiency and agility.        
        Solely placing emphasis on digital infrastructures and the alignment of business with IT 
        are, however, insufficient for the future of the truly collaborative digital enterprise. 
        There is much more at stake in the digital evolution. The digital enterprise needs to also 
        address the additional convergence of applications, data and the capacities to execute, 
        store and connect, truly the convergence of a portfolio of services and choices that offer 
        an optimized combination of policy, placement and capabilities.
