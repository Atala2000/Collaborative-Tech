      <h2>SSL's & PKI's</h2>
      <p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are encryption protocols that are used to secure data transmitted over the internet. These protocols provide secure and encrypted communication between a website and its users, ensuring that sensitive information, such as login credentials and credit card numbers, is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.</p>
      <p>PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) refers to the set of hardware, software, policies, and procedures that are required to create, manage, store, distribute, and revoke digital certificates. Digital certificates are used to authenticate the identity of an entity and to secure data transmission over the internet. PKI enables the use of digital signatures and encryption to establish secure communication between two parties.</p>
      <p>In a PKI system, a trusted third-party entity, known as a Certificate Authority (CA), issues and manages digital certificates. These certificates contain a public key that is used to encrypt data, and a private key that is used to decrypt the data. PKI provides a secure and efficient way to verify the identity of entities involved in online transactions, ensuring the privacy and integrity of sensitive information.</p>
      <h2>Benefits of SSL's & PKI's</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> PKI and digital certificates provide a secure and efficient way to verify the identity of entities involved in online transactions, ensuring that sensitive information is only shared with trusted entities.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> PKI and SSL/TLS provide a secure way to verify the authenticity and integrity of data, ensuring that the data has not been altered during transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> SSL/TLS encryption protocols protect sensitive information transmitted over the internet from eavesdropping and tampering, ensuring that the information remains confidential and secure.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> For many organizations, using SSL and PKI is a requirement for compliance with various regulations and standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</li>
